#  Plot a correlation plot for the variables and check for collinearity

Keep up the progress ....great going !
If we are going to use linear regression for modelling, its necessary to remove correlated variables to improve our model.
This task will help you in understanding the phenomenon of correlation graphically
and hone your skills in handling and visualising multicollinearity.

Just like in previous task for this one too you will need:- 
* Matplotlib which we have already used in Visualization 
* Seaborn which provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. 

## Write a function `cor` that :
- Plots a Correlation Plot for all the variables.

For these you don't need to load the data, we have already done it for you.

**Hint:** 
use corr() functiom

### Parameters:

| Parameter | dtype | argument type | default value | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| data | pandas.DataFrame | compulsory | |Dataframe |

### Returns:

| Return | dtype | description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Plot | | Heatmap plot for correlation |

Let's get started !
