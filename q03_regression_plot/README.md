# Task 3:

In this task you will be plot a regression plot using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries

For these you don't need to load the data, we have already done it for you.

For this task, you are expected to plot a scatter plot for the two variables and check if you can recreate the plot provided in the images folder.

So, far we have only performed Univariate Analysis, now let's move into Multivariate Analysis.

We can make a plot of Numerical Features vs another Numerical Feature.

So, now let's make a plot of a feature in the dataset against another feature in the same dataset.


#### Parameters:

| Parameter | dtype | argument type | default value | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| variable1 |  | compulsory |  | name of the feature |
| variable2 |  | compulsory |  | name of the feature |



#### Returns:

| Return | dtype | description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Plot | | scatter plot for regression |
