# Task 1:

We have already used the house pricing data for our in-class assignments. Now we will use the same data to solve some more assignments.

One of the best ways to get a sense for the variable distribution is to plot a histogram.

A Histogram gives us the representation of data by combining them into bins and drawing bars for 
each bin accordingly.

For this task you will need:- 
* Matplotlib which we have already used in Visualization 
* Seaborn which provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. 

For this assignment you don't need to load the data, we have already done it for you.

You need to plot a histogram for a distribution of the following variables and check whether it is linear or not.
- LotArea
- GarageArea
- OpenPorchSF
- SalePrice

* So we have to check for any skewness in the distribution.
