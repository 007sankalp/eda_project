# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) Implementation using Python

We have seen in the lectures how EDA helps in first level of analysis of data.

EDA helps to analysis between:
- Category

    * Target vs Features
    * Features vs Features

- Numeric

    * Target vs Features
    * Features vs Features

You can revise and refer to the EDA from the slides.

You can use any sklearn objects for the purpose of this exercise

# Learn to Write Sklearn Algorithm to Plot the Features

## Dataset
Now, we will try to implement the Rigde and lasso on the __house_prices_multivariate__ dataset. We have been working with this dataset for some time now. We applied _linear regression_ and _Polynomial linear regression_ to predict the `SalePrice`.


#### Features:

* Total BsmtSF
* Lot Area
* Street 
* OverallQual 
* GrLivArea 
* GarageCars 
* Glazing Area 


#### Response Varaible:

* SalePrice

# Learning Objectives:

We will

* We will Analysis the data before making any intuition or assumptions, by plotting it.
* To sharpen your analytics skills before going into feature selection.


Let's get started!

* For the assignment we will be using this the below packages from sklearn
