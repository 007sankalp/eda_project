# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) Implementation using Python
How to ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project?
How to choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? 
How to define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps to answer all these questions, ensuring the best outcomes for the project.

This project concerns the preliminary analysis and illustration of data related 
to House Prices of 1400 houses in New York.

#What we have learnt so far?
* Initial Exploration
* Introduction to Seaborn
* Univariate Analysis
* Multi-variate Analysis

We have seen in the lectures how EDA helps in first level of analysis of data.

EDA helps use to analyse the following types of features:
* Categorical Features

* Numerical Features

You can revise and refer to the EDA from the slides.

# Learn to use Matplotlib and Seaborn to Plot the Features

## Dataset
We will be using House Pricing dataset. 

We have been working with this dataset for some time now. 

Let's try to perform some visualization on it and get some meaningful insights.

#### Features:

* YearBuilt
* TotalBsmtSF
* GrLivArea 
* SalePrice

## Why solve this assignment?

* We will analyse the data before making any intuition or assumptions, by plotting it.
* To sharpen your analytics skills before going into feature selection.


For the assignment we will be using the below packages :
* matplotlib
* seaborn

By completing this project you have an opportunity to win 300 points

##Let's get started!
