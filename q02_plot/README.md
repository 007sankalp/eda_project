# Draw a boxplot that facilitates comparision between variables or across levels of a categorical variable

Nice work done there ! 
Now that you have learned how to plot a histogram.
Let's dig deeper and explore this world of visualization.

For the record we can also draw a boxplot that facilitates comparision between variables or across levels of a categorical variable.
It also,  helps us in outliers detection, which will help us remove them.

Just like in previous task for this one too you will need:- 
* `Matplotlib` which we have already used in Visualization 
* `Seaborn` which provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. 

For this assignment you don't need to load the data, we have already done it for you.

## Write a function `plot` that :
- Plots a Boxplot for a distribution of the variables `LotArea` ,`GarageArea`, `OpenPorchSF`,`SalePrice`.
- Is giving out the idea of outliers(if any) containing.
- Able to tell range of distributions of above variables.



#### Parameters:

| Parameter | dtype | argument type | default value | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| num_cols | list | compulsory |  | number of columns |



#### Returns:

| Return | dtype | description |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Plot | | outliers for all given columns |

So what are you waiting for let's get started !
