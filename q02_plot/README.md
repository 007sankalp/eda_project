# Visualization 2

Nice work done there ! 

Now that you have learned how to plot a histogram.
Let's dig deeper and explore this world of visualization.

For the record we can also draw a boxplot that facilitates comparision between variables or across levels of a categorical variable.

It also,  helps us in outliers detection, which will help us remove them.

So,let's plot a `boxplot()`

Just like in previous task for this one too you will need:- 
* Matplotlib which we have already used in Visualization 
* Seaborn which provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. 

For these you don't need to load the data, we have already done it for you.

Plot a Boxplot for the same variables and check whether there is any outliers and the range of the distribution.
